<h2>About Golf</h2>
<h3><i>Golf History</i></h3>
    <p>Golf comes from an old word meaning "club." According to the <a href="https://www.igfgolf.org/about-golf/history/">International Golf Federation</a>, early forms of Golf traced back to the Roman game of paganica, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball.</p>
    <p>The modern game of golf, however, originated in Scotland.   According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf">the Wikipedia page for golf</a>, the first written record of golf is James II's banning of the game in 1457, as an unwelcome distraction to learning archery.</p>
    <p>The first Open Championship is played at Prestwick and is won by Willie Park Senior of Scotland, and in 1901, the PGA was first formed in the UK.  Today, golf is enjoyed by 24 million Americans who play 465 million rounds annually at the nation's 15,200 facilities. It continues to be the game of a lifetime.  In 2016, after a 112-year hiatus, golf finally returned to the Olympics in Brazil.</p>

<h3><i>The Game</i></h3>
<p>Every round of golf, typically 18 holes, is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. Each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes; on a nine-hole course, players may play a "short game" playing each hole once, or a "full round" by playing each hole twice. A typical group playing will have 1, 2, 3 or 4 people playing the round. </p>
<p>Golf clubs, composed of a shaft with a grip), are used to hit the golf ball. Long clubs, which have a lower amount of degree loft, are those meant to propel the ball a comparatively longer distance, and short clubs a higher degree of loft and a comparatively shorter distance.</p>
<p> Other equipment used by golfers include:
<ul>
<li>Golf Balls</li><br>
<li>Golf Tees</li><br>
<li>Golf Bag</li><br>
<li>Ball Markers</li><br>
<li>And Much More</li>
</ul></p>
